            <h2>Here is my story...</h2>

            <p>six months before i graduated college (bachelors of marketing), i developed an intense passion for web develoment,
                i read books about programming like the head first series and the "you don't know javascript" series.
                Though after reading, i only had basic ideas and even grew more hungry to learn.
            </p>

            <p>I went ahead and spent all my savings to buy online courses from <a href="https://codewithmosh.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">codewithmosh.com</a>, the price was just right, the date was 17th, July 2022, it was a sunday
                and the time was 1:00 am East African time.
            </p>

            <p>I hapily and consistently studied day and night, drilling through the details in the lessons aiming at understanding,
                knowing why code is running and also why it is not.</p>

            <p>My course instructor,  <b>Mosh Hamedani</b>, took me systematically through the learning path from the fundermentals, to data structures and algorithms, to
                frontend develoment and to backend development. I am very grateful! </p>

            <p>Today, i build fullstack web applications with the knowledge i acquired. Also, i learn endlessly and it is so fulfilling for me 
                to learn from senior developers and teams.</p>
